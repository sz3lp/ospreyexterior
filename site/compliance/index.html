      <h1>Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) Compliance: Converting Liability to Labeled Asset.</h1>
      <p>
        Seattle&rsquo;s combined sewer overflows, rising rainfall intensity, and the Duwamish Source Control program create a new
        compliance calculus for every capital project. King County&rsquo;s O&amp;M mandates and LID requirements now treat every
        stormwater vault, bioretention cell, and infiltration trench as a regulated asset&mdash;with six-figure fines waiting for
        owners who miss inspections or documentation windows.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What drives the cost of stormwater compliance in King County?</h3>
        <p>
          Capital intensity is dictated by impervious surface area, vault sizing requirements, and the documentation burden for
          source control. OSI models each factor to minimize excavation while satisfying municipal code.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does the OSI Compliance Shield reduce O&amp;M liability?</h3>
        <p>
          The platform automates inspection schedules, captures live infiltration and turbidity data, and stores auditable logs
          so your team can demonstrate continuous compliance during EPA or King County reviews.

          requirements with your permitting timeline.
