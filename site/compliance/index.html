      <h1>Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) Compliance: Converting Liability to Labeled Asset.</h1>
      <p>
        Seattle&rsquo;s combined sewer overflows, rising rainfall intensity, and the Duwamish Source Control program create a new
        compliance calculus for every capital project. King County&rsquo;s O&amp;M mandates and LID requirements now treat every
        stormwater vault, bioretention cell, and infiltration trench as a regulated asset&mdash;with six-figure fines waiting for
        owners who miss inspections or documentation windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you are a VP of Development defending pro forma assumptions, a CFO quantifying risk mitigation, or a
        facilities manager tasked with day-to-day source control, OSI engineers certify each GSI asset as a balance-sheet
        performer rather than an O&amp;M liability.

          <p>
            Non-compliant runoff tied to combined sewer overflow or source control violations routinely exceeds six figures in

            Emergency excavation, soil replacement, and vault reconstruction can cost three times the planned preventative

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What drives the cost of stormwater compliance in King County?</h3>
        <p>
          Capital intensity is dictated by impervious surface area, vault sizing requirements, and the documentation burden for
          source control. OSI models each factor to minimize excavation while satisfying municipal code, enabling finance teams
          to quantify reserves and avoid emergency appropriations.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does the OSI Compliance Shield reduce O&amp;M liability?</h3>
        <p>
          The platform automates inspection schedules, captures live infiltration and turbidity data, and stores auditable logs
          so your team can demonstrate continuous compliance during EPA or King County reviews. Alerts flag when stormwater
          vault performance deviates from thresholds so issues are resolved before fines accrue.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>When should we involve OSI in a GSI compliance plan?</h3>
        <p>
          Engage us during schematic design or earlier to value-engineer stormwater vault alternatives and align LID
          requirements with your permitting timeline. Early engagement unlocks source control incentives, utility coordination,
          and inspection bundling that deliver measurable ROI.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can OSI support post-construction compliance audits?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Our civil engineers compile sealed inspection packets, reconcile sensor data against permit conditions, and
          represent your asset during King County or EPA follow-up audits to maintain compliance certifications.
