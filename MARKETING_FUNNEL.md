# Osprey Exterior RainWise-to-Permaculture Funnel

RainWise is positioned as the gateway into a fully integrated outdoor transformation. The subsidized stormwater fix solves an urgent drainage need while opening the door to permaculture design, hardscapes, and exterior remodels that elevate property value and livability.

## 1. Ideal Client Profile & Messaging Principles

- **Who we serve:** Seattle homeowners living inside RainWise-eligible Combined Sewer Overflow basins, typically mid-to high-income professionals who balance environmental ethics with home improvement goals.
- **Key frustrations:** Perpetually soggy lawns, runoff and erosion, confusing rebate paperwork, and a lack of time or know-how to shape their dream yard.
- **Aspirations:** Resilient landscapes that look polished, manage water intelligently, produce food, and boost property value without constant upkeep.
- **Tone of voice:** Authoritative expertise, concierge-level guidance, visionary storytelling, transparent pricing, and the polished look and feel that reflects our build quality.

## 2. Full-Funnel Strategy & Tactics

The funnel is designed to capture RainWise inquiries, cultivate desire for a comprehensive solution, and close multi-service projects.

### Awareness — Attraction

**Goal:** Reach RainWise-eligible homeowners and position Osprey as the premium partner that marries rebates with stunning design.

- **Paid search and social:** Geo-target CSO basins with ads that promise RainWise savings *and* beautiful outdoor living upgrades. Example search headline: “Seattle RainWise Rebates | Maximize Savings & Style.”
- **Paid social creative:** Use the hero image to highlight soggy-yard pain points and promote bundled permaculture and exterior remodel outcomes.
- **Direct mail:** Send high-quality postcards to RainWise zip codes that headline “RainWise Transformation” and showcase integrated garden, cistern, and hardscape imagery.
- **Local partners & events:** Collaborate with nurseries, boutique landscape designers, and community centers to host “RainWise & Your Yard” info sessions and incentivize referrals.

### Interest — Engagement

**Goal:** Encourage prospects to explore our promise in depth and raise their hand for the audit.

- **Landing page hub:** `ospreyexterior.vercel.app` carries the hero statement, RainWise estimator, eligibility checker, differentiating pillars, integrated services, social proof, and a frictionless form with the “Schedule Your Free Whole-Property Water Audit” CTA.
- **Evergreen content:** Publish search-optimized articles and case studies (see Section 4) to build trust and organic traffic.
- **Social drip:** Share short-form videos, before-and-after carousels, and quick tips on water harvesting or edible planting combinations to keep the audience warm.

### Desire — Consideration

**Goal:** Transition the conversation from “rebate paperwork” to “let’s reimagine the entire property.”

- **Whole-Property Water Audit:**
  1. Qualify the lead and pre-frame the audit as a strategic blueprint.
  2. Conduct an on-site walkthrough that diagnoses RainWise opportunities while surfacing adjacent upgrades (edible beds, patios, cistern decking, etc.).
  3. Deliver a quick concept sketch that shows how RainWise elements weave into a broader master plan.
- **Personalized follow-up:** Send a same-day thank-you email recapping opportunities, linking to aligned portfolio work, and inviting questions.
- **Retargeting ads:** Re-engage landing-page visitors and audit attendees with visuals of full backyard transformations and messaging about bundled efficiency.

### Action — Conversion

**Goal:** Close the RainWise scope while motivating clients to authorize additional services.

- **Layered proposals:** Present two transparent sections—RainWise scope with estimated rebate reimbursement, and optional add-ons (permaculture build-out, permeable pavers, cistern enclosures, decks). Call out savings from mobilizing once.
- **Bundled incentives:** Offer small discounts or value-adds (e.g., plant upgrades) for clients who greenlight additional phases alongside RainWise work.
- **Financing:** Provide financing options for the non-rebate portions to reduce budget friction.

## 3. Increasing Project Value Beyond the Rebate

1. **Prime expectations early:** Marketing copy and visuals show RainWise as the *first step* toward the dream yard, not a one-off drainage fix.
2. **Audit storytelling:** Illustrate how captured water feeds edible gardens, how RainWise excavation can pre-stage patio bases, and how custom carpentry hides cisterns while adding livable space.
3. **Transparent bundling:** Make dual scopes easy to authorize by clearly itemizing savings and scheduling efficiencies when services are combined.
4. **Value framing:** Present permaculture, hardscape, and remodel features as long-term investments that add curb appeal, reduce utility costs, and deliver everyday enjoyment.

## 4. Blog Content Roadmap

Publishing cadence: release these posts sequentially, then recycle highlights in emails and social updates.

   - Demystify eligibility, documentation, and timelines while reinforcing that Osprey handles the heavy lifting.
