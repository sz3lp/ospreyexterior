        <article class="card" style="max-width:860px; margin:0 auto;">
          <p>Every October, Bellevue shifts from sun-warmed patios to saturated lawns overnight. The marine layer thickens, the sound of gutters grows louder, and local forecasts warn of the first atmospheric river. If you live anywhere from Somerset ridgelines to Lake Sammamish shorelines, use this guide to audit the weak links before storms expose them. Our <a href="/pages/bellevue/">Bellevue gutter cleaning specialists</a> see the same preventable failures each fall—clogged downspouts, overwhelmed drains, and documentation gaps that stall RainWise rebates.</p>
          <h2>1. Start at the roofline: clean and inspect gutters</h2>
          <p>Your roof is a catchment system. Hundreds of square feet of shingles send water toward a few discharge points, so any debris at those choke points forces overflow. Douglas fir needles, alder catkins, moss, and maple pods compact into a dense mat that resists airflow and blocks outlets by the time September ends.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Walk the perimeter and look for dark streaks under the gutter line—early signs of overflow.</li>
            <li>Use binoculars or a roof camera to spot moss buildup, sagging sections, or standing water.</li>
            <li>Flush at least one downspout with a garden hose; if water backs up, schedule <a href="/services/gutter-cleaning/">professional gutter cleaning</a>.</li>
            <li>Confirm every downspout extension routes water at least five feet from the foundation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Unsure about ladder safety? Osprey Exterior crews deploy vacuum systems and rope access to clear three-story rooflines, flush each downspout, and document results for RainWise files.</p>
          <h2>2. Downspouts and drains: confirm flow paths</h2>
          <p>Homes built after 1980 typically route downspouts to splash blocks or buried pipes that daylight at the curb. Those lines clog with sediment, collapse under roots, or disconnect at elbows. One obstruction can dump roof runoff behind shrubs and into crawlspaces.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Locate every downspout termination; if it dives underground, trace where it should daylight.</li>
            <li>During light rain, stand near each discharge. No flow usually means a blockage.</li>
            <li>Remove detachable elbows and flush from the top and bottom.</li>
            <li>Maintain an air gap between downspout drops and inlet basins to prevent siphoning.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you use cisterns, dispersion trenches, or RainWise diverters, schedule a <a href="/services/drainage/">drainage inspection</a> so technicians can verify flow rates and compliance paperwork in one visit.</p>
          <h2>3. Foundation drainage and soil saturation</h2>
          <p>Somerset slopes contain fast-draining glacial till, while Redmond and Crossroads sit on dense clay that traps moisture. When rain outpaces absorption, hydrostatic pressure pushes water against basement walls and crawlspace footings.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Walk the foundation after rainfall; flag any puddles that linger longer than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Check vent openings for standing water, vegetation, or insect nests.</li>
            <li>Inspect crawlspace vapor barriers for damp spots or pooling.</li>
            <li>Use a dehumidifier in basements and track musty odors—early signs of seepage.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Extending downspout discharge, regrading soil, or adding sump drainage can mitigate pressure. For stubborn clay pockets, see our <a href="/pages/redmond/">clay soil drainage Redmond</a> recommendations.</p>
          <h2>4. Roof penetrations and flashing</h2>
          <p>High winds and temperature swings stress roof penetrations—vents, skylights, chimneys, and satellite mounts. Bellevue’s microclimate pairs heavy rain with near-freezing nights, expanding and contracting flashing seams.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>From the attic, look for daylight around vent boots or plumbing stacks.</li>
            <li>Scan sheathing with a flashlight for dark rings, damp insulation, or active drips.</li>
            <li>Inspect chimney flashing from the ground for lifting edges or rust streaks.</li>
            <li>Check skylight curbs for failed sealant and algae buildup.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Seal any gaps with polyurethane caulk immediately. A $15 tube now can prevent thousands in drywall repairs this winter.</p>
          <h2>5. Trees and overhanging branches</h2>
          <p>Bellevue’s urban canopy delivers year-round debris. Douglas firs drop needles daily, maples shed leaves in sheets, and cedar limbs sway under wind shear. Overhanging branches deposit organic matter that clogs gutters and can rip shingles during gusts.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Trim branches back at least six feet from roof edges.</li>
            <li>Remove dead limbs likely to fall under wind load.</li>
            <li>Clear ivy or climbing plants from siding to reduce trapped moisture.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Hire a certified arborist for major cuts near power lines or steep slopes. Proactive pruning protects gutters and keeps service visits efficient.</p>
          <h2>6. Sump pumps and backflow prevention</h2>
          <p>Basements and crawlspaces across Bellevue rely on sump systems that sit idle through dry months. When the first atmospheric river arrives, those pumps must move thousands of gallons in hours.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unplug and inspect pump intakes for sediment or loose wiring.</li>
            <li>Pour three to four gallons of water into the pit to confirm activation.</li>
            <li>Check discharge lines for obstructions and insulation against freezing.</li>
            <li>Listen for a clunk when the pump shuts off—that indicates the check valve is working.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Document your test in an <a href="/blog/emergency-gutter-cleaning-checklist">emergency gutter checklist</a> so every caretaker knows the procedure during outages.</p>
          <h2>7. Stormwater rebates and compliance</h2>
          <p>Seattle’s RainWise program gets headlines, but King County and Bellevue also incentivize private maintenance of green infrastructure. If your property received a rebate, you must prove ongoing maintenance to stay eligible for future funding.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maintain photo logs of gutter cleanings, downspout flushes, and dispersion trench performance.</li>
            <li>Keep invoices for annual inspections in a shared folder.</li>
            <li>Record flow tests and sump pump verifications during each visit.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Osprey Exterior delivers before/after photos, flow verification, and signed maintenance logs—check our <a href="/blog/rainwise-vs-traditional-drainage">RainWise maintenance details</a> for rebate-specific documentation tips.</p>
          <h2>8. Attic ventilation and moisture balance</h2>
          <p>Heavy rain paired with cool nights traps moisture in attic spaces. Without balanced ventilation, condensation forms on rafters and feeds mold growth.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Confirm soffit vents stay unobstructed by insulation or pest screens.</li>
            <li>Feel for airflow at ridge or gable vents during windy days.</li>
            <li>Install vent baffles where insulation blocks intake.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Proper airflow keeps roof sheathing dry and prevents ice damming when winter temperatures drop.</p>
          <h2>9. Driveway and hardscape drainage</h2>
          <p>Runoff that never touches your gutters still seeks the lowest point. Many Eastside driveways slope toward garages, collecting sheet flow that erodes concrete and seeps under doors.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Watch water movement during moderate rainfall; if it flows toward the house, regrade or add a trench drain.</li>
            <li>Pressure-wash existing trench drains and channel grates to clear sediment.</li>
            <li>Route driveway drains into dispersion systems downstream from roof discharge to balance flow volumes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Small adjustments upstream reduce the load on sump pumps and keep garage slabs dry.</p>
          <h2>10. Preparing for power outages and emergency access</h2>
          <p>Atmospheric rivers often coincide with high winds that topple branches and knock out power. Even short outages stall sump pumps, garage doors, and work lights.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Store a corded shop light or headlamp with spare batteries in an accessible closet.</li>
            <li>Charge portable power banks for phones, cameras, and documentation.</li>
            <li>Keep manual tools—scoops, tarps, leaf rakes—ready for debris removal.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Osprey Exterior runs emergency crews during storm advisories, but homeowner readiness prevents minor issues from escalating.</p>
          <h2>11. When to call for professional help</h2>
          <p>Professional inspections catch invisible threats before they flood your home. Book service immediately if you notice:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Overflow during light rain or damp fascia boards</li>
            <li>Persistent pooling at foundation edges</li>
            <li>Gutters pulling away from fascia or sagging corners</li>
            <li>Mold smells near ceiling edges</li>
            <li>Watermarks around skylights or vent boots</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A same-day visit costs less than one drywall repair and includes photo evidence for insurance claims.</p>
          <h2>12. The financial case for prevention</h2>
          <p>Skipping a fall cleaning might save $250 today, but a single overflow event can exceed $5,000 in repairs once water reaches drywall or electrical chases. Insurance adjusters regularly deny claims citing lack of maintenance.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Schedule cleanings ahead of forecasted storms to avoid emergency premiums.</li>
            <li>Document every visit with photos and invoices for insurers.</li>
            <li>Track rebate compliance deadlines so funding stays intact.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Consistent maintenance protects resale value, meets rebate obligations, and keeps your home insurable.</p>
          <h2>13. Build a seasonal routine</h2>
          <p>Preventive maintenance is easiest when automated. Align service reminders with historical rainfall and leaf drop patterns.</p>
