# Content Guidelines

## Tone of Voice
- Confident, neighborly, and professional.
- Emphasize craftsmanship, safety, and community involvement.
- Avoid fear-based messaging; focus on preventative care and longevity.

## Formatting
- Target 700-900 words for service pages, 1,000+ words for pillar blog posts.
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences) with scannable subheads and bullet lists.
- Include testimonial pull quotes and data callouts in blockquote styling.

## Visual Direction
- Hero images highlight residential exteriors in coastal environments.
- Use before/after sliders where possible; describe them in accompanying copy for accessibility.
- Maintain brand palette defined in `assets/style.css` (deep navy, RainWise green, clean white, and amber CTA accents).

## Prompt Conditioning for AI
- Always provide geo target, service focus, and persona details.
- Require introduction with customer pain point, solution overview, and credibility proof.
- Include CTA referencing local expertise and free onsite estimates.

## Compliance
- Mention licensing and insurance coverage in at least one section per page.
