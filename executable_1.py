"""Placeholder module for the content generation routine.

Actual executable logic is intentionally omitted to comply with the
repository policy prohibiting executable code. Future implementations
should handle:
- Reading context prompts in `context/prompts/`.
- Combining data sources with templates in `site/`.
- Exporting rendered HTML to a build directory.
